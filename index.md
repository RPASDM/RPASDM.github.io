Community page to work on developing RPAS best data management practices.  

Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) (aka “drones”) have rapidly spurred the development of services across all sectors.  From Agriculture, Mining, Conservation, Earth Sciences, and Disaster response, through to Urban Planning, Medical cargo delivery, Search and Rescue, and Police work.  For those domains in which the service is primarily about data delivery or information provision there is no common approach to the data management leaving users to roll their own solutions internally.  This is both costly in terms of development time, and results in unknown data quality, poor data publication, limited to zero data reuse.

FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) and sometimes open data is increasingly becoming a requirement of operation in multiple sectors including academia, government, and NPOs.  The potential increase in value FAIR data offers,  in terms of knowledge gains, and transparency, are very hard to ignore. To achieve FAIR data, however, requires infrastructure which requires community agreed best practices to which the infrastructure may be build.  


The ulitmate goal will be to see ubiquitously FAIR RPAS data.
